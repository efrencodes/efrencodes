## Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="24" height="24"></img>

I’m Efren Martinez, a mid-senior frontend engineer at OCC Mundial, developing digital products and collaborating with UI/UX, Infrastructure, Project Managers and Backend teams.

I’m fluent in JavaScript, React, and Vue.js. I’ve also written a significant amount of HTML and CSS. I learn quickly, pay attention to detail, and am passionate about computer science.

### My current tech stack includes:

* Frontend: ✨ HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Astro, Next.js, React, Vuejs, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
* Backend: ⚡ PHP, GraphQL, Apollo Server
* Mobile: 📱 React Native
* Testing: ⭐ Unit tests with Jest, React Testing Library, E2E tests with Cypress
* Tools: 🔧 Git, GitHub, VSCode, Figma
* Infrastructure: 📦 Docker

In this year 2025, I want to learn about UI/UX, Python, and iOS.

Happy coding! 🚀

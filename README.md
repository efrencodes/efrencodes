## Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="24" height="24"></img>

I’m a Frontend Engineer at OCC Mundial with over 8 years of experience developing web applications and collaborating with teams of UX designers and backend developers.

I’m fluent in JavaScript, React, and Vue.js. I’ve also written a significant amount of HTML and CSS. I learn quickly, pay attention to detail, and am passionate about computer science.

My current tech stack is:

✨ Next.js
✅ React
⚫ TypeScript
⛄ Styled Components / TailwindCSS
⬜ REST API / GraphQL / Apollo Server
❌ Git / GitHub
⭐ Unit tests with Jest, React Testing Library
⚡ E2E testing with Cypress

I’m quick at picking up new languages and tools as needed.
